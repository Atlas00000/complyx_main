# Complyx - IFRS S1 & S2 Readiness Assessment Platform

## Project Overview

**Complyx** is an intelligent conversational platform designed to help organizations assess their readiness for IFRS S1 (Sustainability-related Financial Information Disclosures) and IFRS S2 (Climate-related Disclosures) compliance. The system uses advanced AI to conduct natural, adaptive conversations that evaluate an organization's sustainability compliance status and provide actionable guidance.

### What are IFRS S1 & S2?

IFRS S1 and S2 are international sustainability reporting standards that require organizations to disclose how sustainability and climate-related risks and opportunities affect their business strategy, governance, and financial performance. These standards are becoming mandatory for many organizations globally, requiring comprehensive assessment and documentation of sustainability practices.
